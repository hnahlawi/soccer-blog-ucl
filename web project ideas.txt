web programming ideas:

1- soccer blog shows games and u can comment on them
sign up/login page

user: {id, username, password}
game: {id, home, away, date, round}
team: {id, name, stadium, abbreviation}
post: {user_id, game_id, text, date}


For front end ajax requests:
1- sign in and sign up verification and proper redirection
2- requests to get the games based on the rounds and put them in the second dropdown with their id's
3- display game info after let's go button is clicked
4- get comments from the comment table and display them
5- post request for adding a new comment and displaying it in the dom



requests details:

request: get match by match id  response: team names, stadium, date string

request: get matches by round  response: match string, match ID

request: get comments on a game response: comments with their usernames

request: make a comment, give game id and comment text

request: sign up, cases: username is taken, password is short, passwords do not match (front end), success

request: login, cases: user does not exist, wrong password, success


steps:

1- load the database with teams and matches
2- add route that gets match id, match string for all matches in a round
3- add route that takes one match id and returns home team name, away team name, stadium, and date string
4- get the requests working for drop downs and having id's as name attribute, store selected match id in a hidden input
5- render the team logos and match info
6- add post functionality using session user and hidden input match id
7- implement sign in functionality
8- implement sign up functionality
